"2","General Information","What is a short-term lease?","A short-term lease is a rental agreement for a duration shorter than our standard 45-51 week contracts.

We will do our best to accommodate your enquiry as we strive to provide accommodation for all students but it is subject to our current availability for the academic year so please contact us."

We also have specifically designed dual occupancy studios which are very popular for couples and friends to share as we can provide one large double bed or two twin beds. It is a great option for two people as the rent is shared between two. This allows the rent to be very affordable, whilst still enjoying our premium service and amenities. We recommend booking early to secure your preferred room allocations and ensure that we can allocate your group next to each other."
"4","General Information","What is an ensuite room?","An ensuite room includes a private bedroom with an attached bathroom, providing you with your own toilet, sink, and shower.

"8","Guarantor","What is a guarantor?","A guarantor is someone, typically a parent, guardian, or close relative, who agrees to take financial responsibility for your rent if you are unable to pay. They must be prepared to sign the tenancy agreement upon completion and provide personal documents. Unilife will only ever contact the guarantor if you fall into rent arrears and are not responding to the property managers communication. This is a common request when renting a property in the UK as it provides an added layer of security for landlords."
"9","Guarantor","Why is a guarantor required?","Unilife has four payment plans, providing flexibility for different incomes. A guarantor is required when selecting three or more payment invoices to ensure that rent and other obligations are met in case the tenant fails to pay.

"10","Guarantor","What is a UK-based guarantor?","A UK-based guarantor is a person who is permanently in the UK and is happy to take financial responsibility for your rent, subject to you failing to make rental payments.

However, please be aware that Unilife does not accept international guarantors, they must live in the UK. If a student wishes to pay in three or more invoices and does not have a UK guarantor, we advise students to speak to Housing Hand who will provide guarantor support."
"12","Guarantor","What is a third-party guarantor?","A third-party guarantor is an organisation or service that acts as a guarantor on behalf of the tenant, typically for a fee. These services are often used by international students or those who cannot provide a personal guarantor. Examples include companies like Housing Hand or YourGuarantor in the UK."
